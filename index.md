# Digital Tools for Research

Welcome to Digital Tools for Research, a Griffith [RED](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development) workshop.

## About this workshop

This workshop has five sections, reflecting the phases of research outlined by [Kramer](https://twitter.com/MsPhelps) and [Bosnan](https://twitter.com/jeroenbosman) of Utrecht University in their [extensive 2016 study](https://101innovations.wordpress.com) on scholarly tools (Kramer and Bosnan actually use seven phases, but we have simplified it to five).

Plus we include the following activities:

 - Data cleansing with OpenRefine
 - Data visualisation with Tableau {% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Workshop activities" text=text %}

Of course, a real research project does not neatly move from one phase to the next! You will be moving between them all the time. They are convenient categories in which we can place the kinds of tools that assist you when you are doing that kind of work.

## Structure of the workshop

This workshop has more show-and-tell about it (in the online version, this might be more akin to browsing) than a typical workshop. The reason is that, with the variety of researchers that attend this workshop, we cannot be sure that all tools will be relevant to all participants (in fact, we can be sure that the opposite will be true!) Therefore, we will be presenting you with a selection of tools that we think may be useful, and you are welcome to try, adopt and ask questions about any of them. 

## Preliminary activity

To start with, why not start by putting a number on your own digital toolbox? Take a moment to estimate how many digital tools you use in your research workflow. Once you have come up with a number, click the button below to see where you stand in relation to other researchers.
