# Phase 1 - Preparation

{% include figure.html img="ch-preparation.png" alt="A boy and his tiger look out to the distance" caption="Preparing to embark" width="75%" %}

## Data storage

{% capture alert %}First things first: find a place to put your research. Don't lose it. Keep it secure.{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=alert color=primary %}

### üîÑ Online storage & sync

 - ‚≠êÔ∏è [Cloudstor](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au) - AU University cloud storage - free, FAST!
 - [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
 - [MS OneDrive](https://griffitheduau-my.sharepoint.com/) - use the O365 version

## Backup

{% capture alert %}Remember, sync is not the same as backup!{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=alert %}

Just because you have OneDrive or Google Drive does not mean you have a backup. Run a backup tool in addition to these services. Your best, most secure option is to backup both to a physical hard drive and to an online service.

### üõ∞ Online backup

 - ‚≠êÔ∏è [Griffith Research Storage](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au) Research Drive (speedy) and Research Vault
 - ‚≠êÔ∏è [Arq Backup](www.arqbackup/com) - use Arq to back your computer up to your Cloudstor or to your OneDrive.
 - [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) - popular, paid.
 - [RSync](https://rsync.samba.org) - Here's the nice technical option. RSync is a command-line tool for syncing local folders with an external hard drive or network drive.

### üíΩ Hard-drive backup

 - ‚≠êÔ∏è Time Machine (Mac)
 - ‚≠êÔ∏è Windows Backup (Windows 10)
 - Drag-and-drop - why is this the worst option? Because (a) you will inevitably forget to do it at some point, and (b) each new copy replaces what was there before meaning you can't recover older versions of your work.

## Password security

{% capture alert %}The best way to keep your passwords /different and secure/ is to use a password manager. ‚≠êÔ∏è The best /password/ to use is a /passphrase/.{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=alert color=tertiary %}

### üîê Password managers

Getting used to using a password manager is a great investment in your overall experience of using the Internet. Most password managers have browser plugins that can fill login forms automatically.

 - ‚≠êÔ∏è [LastPass](https://www.griffith.edu.au/passwords/lastpass) - Griffith-supported option
