## Qualitative data capture

### Survey tools üí¨ 

We do recommend that you [get advice from a qualified statistician](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development/statistical-advice) before you design and deploy your survey. They will help you understand the impact your survey and question design will have on the final data output.

 - [Lime Survey](https://prodsurvey.rcs.griffith.edu.au/doco2/) is Griffith's supported survey tool. It is fast, flexible and free. [Workshops](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development/workshop-calendar) and [video resources](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtTT7TqB2izC3THIFCokfIh5DwlOPePH) are available too.
 - [RedCap](https://www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/) is also free and Griffith-supported. It is better suited to clinical and longitudinal studies. Training resources are still under development.
