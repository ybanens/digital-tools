## Qualitative data capture

### Survey tools üí¨ 

{% capture text %}
We do recommend that you have a discussion with a qualified statistician before you design and deploy your survey. They will help you understand the impact your survey and question design will have on the final data output. {% endcapture %}

### [Lime Survey](https://prodsurvey.rcs.griffith.edu.au/doco2/)

This is Griffith's supported survey tool. It is fast, flexible and free. [Workshops](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development/workshop-calendar) and [video resources](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtTT7TqB2izC3THIFCokfIh5DwlOPePH) are available too.

### [RedCap](https://www151.griffith.edu.au/redcap/)
 
RREDCap is also griffith-supported. It is better suited to clinical and longitudinal studies. Training resources are still under development.
