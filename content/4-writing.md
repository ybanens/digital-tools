# Create Lesson Content

Edit the lesson Markdown files to create content pages.

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to [simplify writing](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/writing-markdown.html) content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.
The basics are intuitive, you can learn in about a minute!
See [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html) to get started.

When creating content pages:

- create/edit content pages in the `content` directory.
- to include a page in the nav, add `nav: true` to the file's yml front matter.
- the `title:` value will appear in the nav, sorted in the order of filenames. For simplicity use leading numbers in the lesson page filenames to create correct order.
- the default layout does not add `title` to the page, so that it can be a short for the nav. So add a title in the Markdown content.

## Components Includes

`workshop-template-b` contains a series of [Liquid "includes"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) to add basic [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/) to your Markdown content.
Examples below demonstrate the includes.

--------

#### Figures 

`{% raw %}{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="workshop scene" caption="Library workshops!" width="75%" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="workshop scene" caption="Library workshops!" width="75%" %}

----------

#### Alerts

`{% raw %}{% include alert.md text="This is a Bootstrap [Alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)" align="center" color="success" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include alert.md text="This is a [Bootstrap Alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)" align="center" color="success" %}

-----------

#### Link Buttons 

`{% raw %}{% include button.md text="Bootstrap Docs" link="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/" color="info" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include button.md text="Bootstrap Docs" link="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/" color="info" %}

---------

#### Cards

``{% raw %}
{% capture text %}
1. Can add more complex text using markdown.
2. Use a Liquid capture to create the text.
3. It magically becomes a [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md text=text header="Example Card" title="Title example" img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" %}{% endraw %}
