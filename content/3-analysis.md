[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a free, open-source tool for cleaning messy data. Do you have a survey data set with responses like 'no', nah', 'not really', and 'n/a' that all mean the same thing? Or rows of data that need to be split or combined? OpenRefine is very good at tidying this sort of thing.
